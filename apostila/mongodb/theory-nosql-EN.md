This kind of database exists for a while now, it just didn't have this name. The term was created in 2009 by Eric Evans, a former worker at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), in an event organized by Johan Oskarsson from [Last.fm](Last.fm).

It doesn't mean that we can't use SQL in NoSQL. Some NoSQL database uses a kind of SQL. So how should we called? NoSQL sometimes is called Not Just SQL. But a better term would be:

> NoREL database: No Relational database

Historically NoSql was a good term because gave visibility to this kind of database. It was a good marketing, as JavaScript named after Java. 

Divisions inside NoSQL database is made by its core, how it handle the data. Let's learn about some of them to understand where we are getting into. :P

I'm going to explain a little about the following groups:

- Key/Value pair store
- Documents store
- Graph store
- Collumn store

As we know, relationals database have broad perspective, and everything that is generalist can't solve a specific problem in the best way possible. For this kind of specific problem we use NoSQL database, widely used in business intelligence projects,
because NoSQL have 4 main characteristics.
