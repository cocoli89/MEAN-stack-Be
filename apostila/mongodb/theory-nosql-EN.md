his kind of database exists for a while now, it just didn't have this name. The term was created in 2009 by Eric Evans, a former worker at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), in an event organized by Johan Oskarsson from [Last.fm](Last.fm).

It doesn't mean that we can't use SQL in NoSQL. Some NoSQL database uses a kind of SQL. So how should we called? NoSQL sometimes is called Not Just SQL. But a better term would be:

> NoREL database: No Relational database

Historically NoSql was a good term because gave visibility to this kind of database. It was a good marketing, as JavaScript named after Java. 

In this NoSQL database we have some big groups with a diversity of database with a diferent objectives. Let's know some of them to understand where we are getting into. :P

I'm going to explain a little about the following groups:

- Key/Value pair
- Documents
- Graph
- Collumn
